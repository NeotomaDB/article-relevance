    "# Prediction Pipelines with `article_relevance`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Article relevance tool was designed for use with the Neotoma Paleoecology Database to produce a workflow that allows users to supply an updatable list of DOIs from publications. This list of DOIs is then used to extract metadata from [CrossRef](https://crossref.org) that can be constructed into a list of text embeddings from which we can develop predictive models.  The tooling allows us to generate multiple predictive models, along with the ability to perform a grid-search for optimal hyper-parameter tuning for all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow provides predictive outputs as to whether an article might be suited for inclusion into a research database, a probability estimate for the prediction, as well as time-stamped predictions and the ability of a user to override the prediction. In this way we can test model evolution, and provide the opportunity for curated stewardship of model predictions."
